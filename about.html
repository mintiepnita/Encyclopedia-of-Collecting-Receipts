          My Message to You : <br /><br />
          In creating this encyclopedia, my goal is to also share my insights
          and experiences with other collectors of receipts as well as curious
          readers.Through exploring the complexities of collecting receipts,
          navigating through many return and refund policies of retailers, and
          examining the underlying psychology of consumer behavior, I hope that
          this encyclopedia will serve as a valuable resource for anyone seeking
          to understand the complexities of collecting receipts and the
          implications it can have on our lives.

          By the time I didn't realize, I found myself having an enormous pile
          of receipts in front of my computer desk. From the simplest purchases
          to the most significant transactions, I was actually meticulously
          saving every piece of paper that documented my spending. For as long
          as I can remember, I've had a habit of collecting receipts -- a habit
          that has often been met with bemusement by friends. <br /><br />As the
          author of this website, I find myself drawn to the habit of collecting
          receipts, often storing them away for safekeeping, just in case I
          might need them for a return or refund. Over time, this habit evolved
          into a comprehensive collection, prompting me to explore more about
          receipts.
